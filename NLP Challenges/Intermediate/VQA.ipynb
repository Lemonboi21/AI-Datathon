    "In this notebook, I will be using the VQA v2.0 dataset to train a model that can answer questions about images. The dataset consists of images from the COCO dataset, questions about the images, and answers to the questions. The questions are open-ended and can be answered in natural language. The answers are multiple-choice and are chosen from a set of 1000 possible answers.\n",
